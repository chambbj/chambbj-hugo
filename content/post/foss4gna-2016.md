As [previously mentioned]({{< relref "post/crossing-the-streams.md" >}}), I presented my talk on "Filtering point clouds with PDAL and PCL" at [FOSS4G North America 2016](https://2016.foss4g-na.org/) this morning. I'm happy to announce that the slides are now [posted](http://bit.ly/1T3yhg3).

If you made it out to Raleigh and saw the talk in person, thanks for attending! If not, a video of the talk should be posted in the near future. I'll be sure to share the link as soon as it is ready.
